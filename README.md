PuttyColors
===========

A Solarized Dark theme modified for use with PuTTY and PuTTY Tray.

Right now it only supports sessions from files using PuTTY Tray. 

### Installation
Under saved sessions in PuTTY Tray, select *Sessions from file*. When saving sessions, you will now find them in a folder called *Sessions* in the same folder as putty.exe is run from.   
Open the file with a name representing your sessions' name in a text editor, and switch out the colorcodes with the ones you find in [solarized_dark_puttytray.txt](https://github.com/joms/PuttyColors/blob/master/solarized_dark_puttytray.txt).   
Reopen PuTTY Tray, and you're good to go!
